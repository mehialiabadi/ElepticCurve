How to implemnt pure Eleptic Curve on Finite Field in python?
Let's kick off with some explanation on EC and why we need to be limited in Finite feild in practice

The elliptic curve equation over the finite field ùîΩp takes the following form:

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=
y^2 ‚â° x^3 + ax + b (mod p))


All algebraic operations within the field:
  Point addition: if R and Q are two point on curve, we can uniquely compute R+Q 
  Multiplication: if R is a point on curve and k be any arbitraty number, we an compute k*R
  Point reverse: given any point R, we can take ‚àíR to be the point opposite it.
  Point subtraction: if R and Q are two point on curve, R-Q means addition of  R+(-Q)
  
  If R be a point on curve R+(-R)=0, indeed P+Q=0 means R and Q are opposite of each other.
